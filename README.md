# Word2Image: convert 10000 words to images

## Project steps
1. Find out 10000 most used words in some language
2. Create a basic app to display 4 pictures for any of words
3. Fill the app with default google search images as a starting step
4. Improve the word->image matching with various heuristic and empirical methods
5. Write down all the cool things we learned along the way

We will use German as target language. 10000 most frequent words will be extracted by analyzing text of german wikipedia. You can find it [here](https://dumps.wikimedia.org), or more specifically [here](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/dewiki/20170920/dewiki-20170920-pages-articles.xml.bz2)

Download wiki bz2 file in text-analysis directory in this repo but please do NOT add it to the project, it is 6.4 Gigabytes!
